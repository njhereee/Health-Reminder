## 🚀 How to Welcome Your Buddy Home (Installation & Setup)

Ready to bring your Health Buddy to life on your computer? Follow these cozy steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/njhereee/Health-Reminder-App.git
    cd Health-Reminder-App # Or whatever your repo name is!
    ```

2.  **Set Up Your Web Server (XAMPP/LAMP/MAMP/WAMP):**

      * Make sure your local server (Apache and MySQL) is up and humming.
      * Place the `healthreminder` folder directly into your XAMPP's `htdocs` directory.

3.  **Database Heartbeat:**

      * Open phpMyAdmin (usually `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`).
      * Create a new database (e.g., `healthreminder`).
      * Import the `healthreminder.sql` file into your new database. This will set up all the necessary tables (users, reminders, appointments, todos, reports, blog\_posts, user\_settings).
      * **Important:** Ensure your database connection settings in your PHP backend files are correctly pointing to this new database (e.g., `user='root'`, `pass=''`, `db='healthreminder'`).

4.  **Backend Dependencies (if any):**

      * If your backend uses Composer for PHP dependencies (like a PDF library or SMS gateway client), navigate to the `backend/` folder in your terminal and run `composer install`. (If not, you can skip this step\!)

5.  **Access Your Buddy\!**

      * Open your web browser and visit: `http://localhost/healthreminder/` (or `http://localhost/healthreminder/login.php` if it starts with a login page).
